Based on the discussions with the PO, we created this diagram for the project requirements: <br><br>
![Requirements](./images/Requirements.png)
<br>
<br>
<br>

We also discussed who the average users would be. Based on that, we created these personas: <br><br>
![Personas](./images/Personas.png)
<br>

<br>

Finally, using the diagram, we created these designs: <br><br>

![Design2](./images/Design-2.png)
![Design3](./images/Design-3.png)
![Design4](./images/Design-4.png)
![Design5](./images/Design-5.png)
<br>

And some designs for an admin page that are not applicable: <br><br>
